Script compares two files per line whether they are equal or not. The user also has the option to display additional
information such as whitespaces in case the file content is equal in every aspect except scenarios,
where for instance instead of a tab there are multiple whitespaces, or if there are whitespaces at the end of a line,
are however not noticed.

Script was inspired by the 4th assignment of the course "188.923 Model Engineering"
